The symptoms lists below have been culled and summarized from current diagnostic criteria most commonly used in the United States by mental health professionals. Read through the list below to confirm your nerd status. You're most likely a nerd if you present at least four of the following behaviors:

*   **Participation in abnormal/nerd activities.** Symptoms may include:
    *   Watching anime and/or reading manga
    *   Playing any game with blocky or 2D graphics where a major part of gameplay is building things or stacking blocks
    *   Playing indie games and/or any games older than ten years
    *   Watching indie movies and/or any movies older than twenty years
    *   Listening to indie music and/or listen to any music older than forty years
    *   Having an unusually high interest in STEM subjects
*   **Holding insensible political opinions.** Symptoms may include:
    *   Supporting Ron Paul for president of the United States
    *   Identifying with an abnormal political philosophy such as libertarianism or anarchism
    *   Having the view that the NSA is watching everything you do online
*   **OSSA (Open Source Software Addiction).** Symptoms may include:
    *   Use of the Linux operating system
    *   Preference for open source software
    *   Few or no proprietary software packages installed
    *   Looking at the license when considering whether to download/use new software

These are some of the most common indicators of being a nerd. Not presenting any of the above behaviors isnâ€™t a guarantee that you are not a nerd. Likewise, you may present the above behaviors and not be a nerd. This list will be expanded upon as our research comes along.
