If you have heard of open source software, then you have most likely heard of the
GNU Project. The GNU project's stated mission is to "preserve, protect and promote
the freedom to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer software, and
to defend the rights of Free Software users". To accomplish this, they have taken
upon the task to create and maintain *free software*. The difference between "free"
and "open source" is, according Richard Marx Stallman, that "free" software is
written for the *ideological* benefits rather than the supposed technical benefits
open source has. This idea has been dubbed the *Free Software movement* and is
thus more of a political campaign than it is a software project. Heck, the Free
Software Foundation [even admits it](http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/)!

At this point, the alarms should start chiming. People who write software based
on ideologies or "ethics" are almost *certainly* mentally ill. It is OK (to a
certain degree) to make software freely available for its technical benefits, but
if you do it for ideological reasons, you should seek a doctor immediately. With
that having been said, this article will be focusing on the political/ethical
aspects of the Free Software movement, which makes sense since you can't compare
political movements with software projects.

## Hiding the Truth

Similar to how North Korea oppresses any criticism directed towards their
leadership, the GNU project, in stark contrast to the open source initiative,
does not accept criticism, nor competition. If a software package is proprietary,
it is *evil* and must be destroyed... or, in this case, *hidden* from the public.
And there will be [no compromises](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22richard+stallman%22+%22no+compromises%22)
either, even if they, ironically, would be beneficial for the Free Software movement
in the long run.

"This is bullshit," you might think. Sadly, it is not. The Free Software movement
hopes to create a society in which the concept of proprietary software is *non-existent*.
In fact, they recently attempted this with the One Laptop Per Child project, which
they hoped could be used to shield an entire *population* from proprietary software.
Thankfully, it has [failed](http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/peru/who_is_to_blame_for_olpc_peru.html)

## Why the Truth is Dangerous to Free Software

In North Korea, the truth about the outside world must be either hidden or twisted
in order to keep the citizens from raising up against the regime. In the Free
Software world, the truth must be hidden in order to keep computer users from
using good software.

If free software really is superior from a technical viewpoint, as the various
movements and initiatives out there might imply, then why do GNU and the FSF feel
the need to hide it from e.g. poor children? Because it simply is **not** superior.
Have a go for yourself: download GIMP and Photoshop, then figure out which is the
best graphics editor in terms of capabilities. Oh, and let your mother try surfing
the web without proprietary plugins, then explain to her why she can't log in to
her online banking account. She is going to think of you as a wacko.

In both cases, chances are that your goals will not be accomplished without the
use of proprietary software. Yes, not all proprietary software is *good*, but
using it shouldn't bother you unless you obsess over trivial "ethical" issues.
If you worry about *technical* issues, you could just run it in a virtual machine.
The only real-world issue with proprietary software is that it's better than free
software, and is therefore a distraction to the Free Software movement. Which
brings me to my next point...


## Free Software Only Benefits the Nerds

The GNU project has four "essential freedoms" which must apply to a software package before it can be considered "free":

<ol start="0">
<li>[The freedom] to run the program.</li>
<li>... to study and change the program in source code form.</li>
<li>... to redistribute exact copies.</li>
<li>... to distribute modified versions.</li>
</ol>

Why does the GNU Project think that the average computer user needs to or should
care about these issues (perhaps except for issue "0")? When my high school handed
out laptops to freshmen, they all had OpenOffice preinstalled. Despite OpenOffice
being open source, not even I, a former mentally ill Linux nerd, have ever wanted
to change its source code or redistribute it. And while I can't really speak for
others, I'm sure that this applies to *every other student* in my school too.

So if the nerds aren't even taking advantage of the supposed benefits with free
software, just *what* is the point?

## Extremists in the Software World

The answer to the question above [can be found](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fs-motives.html)
on the GNU Project's own website, in an article about what motivates people to
write free software:

>   <h3>Hatred for Microsoft.</h3>
>
>   It is a mistake to focus our criticism narrowly on Microsoft. Indeed,
>   Microsoft is evil, since it makes non-free software. Even worse, it
>   implements Digital Restrictions Management in that software. But many other
>   companies do one or both of these.
>
>   Nonetheless, it is a fact that many people utterly despise Microsoft, and
>   some contribute to free software based on that feeling.

Yes, it is indeed a mistake to focus on Microsoft's so-called wrongdoings.
However, because the GNU website doesn't distance itself from hatred *in
general*, **they imply that hatred is completely acceptable in the Free Software
Movement**. Hatred is a core value in political extremism.

The hatred amongst Free Software evangelists is so common that even Linus Torvalds
had to go out and distance himself from the movement:

>   There are "extremists" in the free software world, but that's one major reason
>   why I don't call what I do "free software" any more. I don't want to be
>   associated with the people for whom it's about exclusion and hatred.
>
>   — [Linus Torvalds](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7439/)

So there you have it. The Free Software movement is run *entirely* by extremist
**nerds** and is *driven* by hatred... of software makers.

And the freetards wonder why no one takes them seriously?
