Avoiding open sores shitware can be hard. Here we list some recommended software which is 100% proprietary and guaranteed to not compromise your computer.

## Recommended web browsers: Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 8

While all versions of IE are great, you know you can't go wrong with these powerful browsers as they have been [dominating the browser market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Desktop_Market_share_by_year_and_version) since the end of the abortion known as "Netscape". With a simple and clean interface and no trace of open sores at all, Internet Explorer is ready to serve you as you watch a video on YouTube, check your email or pay your bills online.

Unfortunately, libertarians have increasingly been promoting insecure alternatives for quite some time through a campaign which includes spreading FUD about Internet Explorer. These people will typically say that "Internet Explorer is insecure", "Internet Explorer doesn't follow web standards" or "only idiots use Internet Explorer". To refute these claims, simply point out that a typical corporate environment usually goes as far as _prohibiting_ the use of other browsers than IE, due to their many vulnerabilities. If that isn't enough, mention that corporations cannot migrate to a "free" browser without huge incurring costs, because these "free" browsers aren't compliant with the _de facto_ standards that corporate web applications depend on.
